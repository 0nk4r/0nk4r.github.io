# Threat Modeling 101: A Security Engineer's Guide

Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying and addressing potential security threats in your applications and systems. As a security engineer, understanding and implementing effective threat modeling is crucial for building secure software.

## What is Threat Modeling?

Threat modeling is a structured process that helps you:
- Identify potential security threats
- Prioritize security controls
- Make informed security decisions
- Document security requirements

## The Four Key Questions

When conducting threat modeling, always ask these fundamental questions:

1. What are we building?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good job?

## Common Threat Modeling Methodologies

### STRIDE
- **S**poofing
- **T**ampering
- **R**epudiation
- **I**nformation Disclosure
- **D**enial of Service
- **E**levation of Privilege

### PASTA
- Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
- Risk-centric approach
- Focuses on business impact

## Best Practices

1. Start early in the development lifecycle
2. Involve all stakeholders
3. Keep documentation up to date
4. Use visual diagrams
5. Regular review and updates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overcomplicating the process
- Focusing only on technical threats
- Ignoring business context
- Not updating models regularly

## Tools and Resources

- Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool
- OWASP Threat Dragon
- Draw.io for diagrams
- Threat modeling templates

## Conclusion

Threat modeling is an essential practice for security engineers. By implementing a structured approach to threat modeling, you can significantly improve your application's security posture.

Remember: The goal is not to eliminate all threats but to understand and manage them effectively.
