title: Treatment effect heterogeneity and linear regression
excerpt_separator:  <!--more-->
---

In _Mostly Harmless Econometrics_ (3.3.7, p75), the _ordinary least square_ (OLS) estimand is given by

$$
\frac{E[ \sigma_D^2 (X_i) \delta_X ]}{\sigma_D^2 (X_i)}
$$

where $\sigma_D^2(X_i)^2$ is the variance of treatment variable $D$ and $\delta_X$ is the stratum specific treatment effect.
The formula simply says that under heterogeneous treatment effect, the OLS estimates a variance weighted average over $\delta_X$.
In certain cases, this might not be the policy relevant measure although it retains the notion of causal effects.
Read MHE for more details.

After some time, I read Wooldrige's recent [work](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3906345) on staggered difference-in-differences.
In this work, Wooldridge shows a simple solution to negative weights arising in _two-way fixed effects_ (TWFE) when TE is heterogeneous.
One thing that catached my eyes was the mean-centering of the covariates to preserve the _average treatment effect of the treated_ (ATT) interpretation of the main coefficient.
Again, read the paper for more details.

Soon after, I found that another [work](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07474938.2020.1824732?journalCode=lecr20) by Wooldridge (with Negi) which uses the same technique to estimate OLS.
After a close inspection, I realized that all these works share the same soul and can be derived using the machinary of MHE.
This blog post is simply a personal note on how I derive and understand these fantastic works.

With bianry treatment variable $D$ and outcome $Y$, we write potential outcomes as $Y(d)$ ($d=0,1$).
With consistency assumption $Y = Y(d)$ if $D=d$, we can write the famous switching formula.

$$ Y = D \cdot Y(1) + (1-D) \cdot Y(0) $$

A careful reordering gives the following form.

$$ Y = (Y(1) - Y(0)) \cdot D + Y(0) = \tau \cdot D + Y(0) $$.

Let $X$ be the covariates that are confoudners or effect modifiers (or both).
