    - name: 'MarcoPolo: a clustering-free approach to the exploration of differentially expressed genes along with group information in single-cell RNA-seq data'
      journal: Nucleic Acids Research 
      fauthor: Chanwoo Kim*, Hanbin Lee*
      author: Juhee Jeong, Keehoon Jung and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac216 
      description: MarcoPolo prioritizes potentially important genes in a single-cell RNA sequencing data through a unique ranking system. The method first fits a bimodal Poisson distribution and uses the fitted attributes to generate ranks of genes using four distinct metrics. The process does not require preceeding clustering of cells so it is robust to clustering results which are sensitive to program parameters.

    - name: 'A theory-based practical solution to correct for sex-differential participation bias'
      journal: Forthcoming, accepted at Genome Biology
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02703-0 
      description: The paper shows that sex-differential participation bias is largely dependent to the overall participation rate of a genetic cohort under standard parameteric assumptions. The major findings are (1) selection bias is highly sensitive to the parametric choice of the participation model (2) bias due to discrete variables contributing to study participation can be mitigated through stratification under low participation rate. As a result, it raises concern on the use of commercial genetic cohorts in which the target population is poorly specified, in turn, making the overall participation rate unidentifiable.

    - name: 'FastRNA: an efficient exact solution for PCA of single-cell RNA sequencing data based on a batch-accounting count model'
      journal: Under Review at the American Journal of Human Genetics
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      description: FastRNA produces batch-corrected low-dimensional representation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. We combine (1) the theory of sufficient statistics and (2) eigendecomposition to derive a completely sparse algorithm to perform feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). The memory consumption and runtime is two to four orders of magnitude faster than competing methods, enabling atlas-scale scRNA-seq data analysis within an ordinary personal computer.

    - name: 'A universal regression framework for genome-wide association study'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      description: We propose a universal regression equation derived from potential outcome (PO) framework and population genetics. The theoretical derivation of the regression equation sheds light on the quantities that has been frequently estimated in conventional GWAS studies and show that the intuitive interpretation of regression coefficients are largely misleading. Next, we apply our regression equation to real data and show that the use of the correct equation can lead to improved interpretability and power of association signals.
