    - name: 'FastRNA: an efficient exact solution for PCA of single-cell RNA sequencing data based on a batch-accounting count model'
      journal: American Journal of Human Genetics, in press
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.09.008
      description: FastRNA produces batch-corrected low-dimensional representation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. We combine (1) the theory of sufficient statistics and (2) eigendecomposition to derive a completely sparse algorithm to perform feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). The memory consumption and runtime are two to four orders of magnitude smaller than competing methods, enabling atlas-scale scRNA-seq data analysis within an ordinary personal computer.

    - name: 'A theory-based practical solution to correct for sex-differential participation bias'
      journal: Genome Biology
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02703-0 
      description: The paper shows that sex-differential participation bias is largely dependent to the overall participation rate of a genetic cohort under standard parameteric assumptions. The major findings are (1) selection bias is highly sensitive to the parametric choice of the participation model (2) bias due to discrete variables contributing to study participation can be mitigated through stratification under low participation rate. As a result, it raises concern on the use of commercial genetic cohorts in which the target population is poorly specified, in turn, making the overall participation rate unidentifiable. 
  
    - name: 'MarcoPolo: a clustering-free approach to the exploration of differentially expressed genes along with group information in single-cell RNA-seq data'
      journal: Nucleic Acids Research 
      fauthor: Chanwoo Kim*, Hanbin Lee*
      author: Juhee Jeong, Keehoon Jung and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac216 
      description: MarcoPolo prioritizes potentially important genes in a single-cell RNA sequencing data through a unique ranking system. The method first fits a bimodal Poisson distribution and uses the fitted attributes to generate ranks of genes using four distinct metrics. The process does not require preceeding clustering of cells so it is robust to clustering results which are sensitive to program parameters.

    - name: 'Disentangling linkage and population structure in association mapping'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee* and Moo Hyuk Lee*
      year: 2022
      description:  Genome-wide association study (GWAS) tests single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the genome to localize the underlying causal variant of a trait. Because causal variants are seldom observed directly, a surrogate model based on genotyped markers are widely considered. Although many methods estimating the parameters of the surrogate model have been proposed, the connection between the surrogate model and the true causal model is yet investigated. In this work, we establish the connection between the surrogate model and the true causal model. Our theory shows the importance of the underlying demographic model in understanding the signal in GWAS. 

   - name: 'Powerful and robust differnetially expressed gene analysis in single-cell RNA sequencing'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      description: We demonsrate the power and robustness of Poisson regression in differentially expressed gene analysis (DEG) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We show that Poisson regression is (1) robust to any over or underdispersion of data, (2) effectively controls type 1 error rate, (3) powerful than pseudobulk methods and (4) fast and efficient enough to run on affordable computing systems.
