    - name: 'FastRNA: an efficient exact solution for PCA of single-cell RNA sequencing data based on a batch-accounting count model'
      journal: American Journal of Human Genetics
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.09.008
      description: FastRNA produces batch-corrected low-dimensional representation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. We combine (1) the theory of sufficient statistics and (2) eigendecomposition to derive a completely sparse algorithm to perform feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). The memory consumption and runtime are two to four orders of magnitude smaller than competing methods, enabling atlas-scale scRNA-seq data analysis within an ordinary personal computer.

    - name: 'A theory-based practical solution to correct for sex-differential participation bias'
      journal: Genome Biology
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02703-0 
      description: The paper shows that sex-differential participation bias is largely dependent to the overall participation rate of a genetic cohort under standard parameteric assumptions. The major findings are (1) selection bias is highly sensitive to the parametric choice of the participation model (2) bias due to discrete variables contributing to study participation can be mitigated through stratification under low participation rate. As a result, it raises concern on the use of commercial genetic cohorts in which the target population is poorly specified, in turn, making the overall participation rate unidentifiable. 
  
    - name: 'MarcoPolo: a clustering-free approach to the exploration of differentially expressed genes along with group information in single-cell RNA-seq data'
      journal: Nucleic Acids Research 
      fauthor: Chanwoo Kim*, Hanbin Lee*
      author: Juhee Jeong, Keehoon Jung and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac216 
      description: MarcoPolo prioritizes potentially important genes in a single-cell RNA sequencing data through a unique ranking system. The method first fits a bimodal Poisson distribution and uses the fitted attributes to generate ranks of genes using four distinct metrics. The process does not require preceeding clustering of cells so it is robust to clustering results which are sensitive to program parameters.

    - name: 'Theoretical Interpretation of Genetic Association Studies in Admixed Populations'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee* and Moo Hyuk Lee*
      doi: https://github.com/hanbin973/hanbin973.github.io/raw/master/_data/LeeAndLee2023b.pdf

      description: Admixed populations are formed through complicated evolutionary processes resulting in heterogeneous linkage disequilibrium patterns. This hampered the interpretation of genetic association studies followed by the development of various methods tailored for the purpose without clear guidance. In this work, we propose a unifying theory built upon population genetics and causal inference that brings a straightforward interpretation of GWAS findings in admixed populations. Furthermore, the theory establishes the connection between distinct methods in admixed GWAS. Finally, we propose two novel tests motivated by our theory that combine association and admixture signals. 

    - name: 'Disentangling linkage and population structure in association mapping'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee* and Moo Hyuk Lee*
      doi: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00904  
      year: 2023
      description: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) tests single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the genome to localize the underlying causal variant of a trait. Because causal variants are seldom observed directly, a surrogate model based on genotyped markers are widely considered. Although many methods estimating the parameters of the surrogate model have been proposed, the connection between the surrogate model and the true causal model is yet investigated. In this work, we establish the connection between the surrogate model and the true causal model. The connection shows that population structure is accounted in GWAS by modelling the variant of interest and not the trait. Such observation explains how environmental confounding can be partially corrected using genetic covariates and why the previously claimed connection between PC correction and linear mixed models is incorrect. 

    - name: 'Why do cell-level test methods for detecting differentially expressed genes fail in single-cell RNA-seq data?'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2023
      description: Earlier studies have found that cell-level tests for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibit inflated type 1 error in multi-subject scRNA-seq data. Pseudoreplication – cells from a same subject are non-independent observations – is thought to be the major cause which motivates the use of the pseudobulk. In this work, we argue that distributional misspecification, rather than pseudoreplication, might be a major cause of the inflated type 1 error in scRNA-seq DEG. We propose a simple solution to existing cell-level test methods that makes them robust against distributional misspecification. Using real data, we show that the robust generalized linear models (GLMs) that are free of distribution constraints perform well, providing both controlled type 1 error and high statistical power. Since the solution is widely available in existing software, it can be immediately adapted to scRNA-seq analysis ecosystems.
