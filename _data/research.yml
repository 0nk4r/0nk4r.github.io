    - name: 'MarcoPolo: a clustering-free approach to the exploration of differentially expressed genes along with group information in single-cell RNA-seq data'
      journal: Nucleic Acids Research 
      fauthor: Chanwoo Kim*, Hanbin Lee*
      author: Juhee Jeong, Keehoon Jung and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac216 
      description: MarcoPolo prioritizes potentially important genes in a single-cell RNA sequencing data through a unique ranking system. The method first fits a bimodal Poisson distribution and uses the fitted attributes to generate ranks of genes using four distinct metrics. The process does not require preceeding clustering of cells so it is robust to clustering results which are sensitive to program parameters.

    - name: 'A theory-based practical solution to correct for sex-differential participation bias'
      journal: Genome Biology
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02703-0 
      description: The paper shows that sex-differential participation bias is largely dependent to the overall participation rate of a genetic cohort under standard parameteric assumptions. The major findings are (1) selection bias is highly sensitive to the parametric choice of the participation model (2) bias due to discrete variables contributing to study participation can be mitigated through stratification under low participation rate. As a result, it raises concern on the use of commercial genetic cohorts in which the target population is poorly specified, in turn, making the overall participation rate unidentifiable. 

    - name: 'FastRNA: an efficient exact solution for PCA of single-cell RNA sequencing data based on a batch-accounting count model'
      journal: Forthcoming at American Journal of Human Genetics
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      description: FastRNA produces batch-corrected low-dimensional representation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. We combine (1) the theory of sufficient statistics and (2) eigendecomposition to derive a completely sparse algorithm to perform feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). The memory consumption and runtime are two to four orders of magnitude smaller than competing methods, enabling atlas-scale scRNA-seq data analysis within an ordinary personal computer.

    - name: 'Population genetic and counterfactual interpretation of genome-wide association study in admixed populations'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Moo Hyuk Lee*, Chanwoo Kim*
      author: Buhm Han and Hanbin Lee
      year: 2022
      description: We propose a correct regression specification for association mapping in admixed populations through population genetics and causal inference. The theoretical properties of widely adopted estimators in admixed GWAS are discussed. We show that although the Armitage Trend Test (ATT) for quantitative traits is biased, the bias reduces as the strength of linkage disequilibrium (LD) increases and eventually vanishes under perfect linkage. This makes QATT the optimal test for discovering susceptibility loci. However, the bias can be severe when using genome-wide summary statistics produced by QATT to perform downstream analysis. We provide theoretically grounded guidelines for performing GWAS in admixed data and demonstrate it using the admixed samples in the UK Biobank.

    - name: 'Powerful and robust differnetially expressed gene analysis in single-cell RNA sequencing'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      description: We demonsrate the power and robustness of Poisson regression in differentially expressed gene analysis (DEG) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We show that Poisson regression is (1) robust to any over or underdispersion of data, (2) effectively controls type 1 error rate, (3) powerful than pseudobulk methods and (4) fast and efficient enough to run on affordable computing systems. 

    - name: 'A general fine-mapping framework for genome-wide association study through frequentist semiparametric regression'
      journal: In preparation
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      description: The widely adopted Bayesian fine-mapping methods provide posterior distirbution of the likelihood for a given SNP to be the causal variant. Instead of providing the posterior distribution, we propose a framework that jointly estimates the position and the effect size of the causal variant using semiparametric regression. The framework can be naturally extended to include multiple ancestry and further improve the precision when admixed samples are availble.
